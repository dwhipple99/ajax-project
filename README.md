This project contains an example of a modern Web application designed
in the format of an AJAX application.

AJAX is an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (or JSON).

It is the standard modern web application.  I chose to use an example
application that gives additional detail about a location a person may 
be considering moving too.  

Enter your address, and the following API's are called:

	- Google Maps (Streetview) API to display a streetview background of the address.
		This is working as of 11/15
	- NY Times API to display recent news articles
		This is working as of 11/24
	- Wikipedia API to display interesting Wiki articles about the location

The project also uses JQuery, a de-facto modern web library found in more than 
50% of modern web sites.

The idea for the project originally came from an on-line class on Udacity on AJAX.
